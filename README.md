## Introduction

The problem of community-level information pathway prediction (CLIPP) aims at predicting the transmission trajectory of content across online communities. A successful solution to CLIPP holds significance as it facilitates the distribution of valuable information to a larger audience and prevents the proliferation of misinformation. Notably, solving CLIPP is non-trivial as inter-community relationships and influence are unknown, information spread is multi-modal, and new content and new communities appear over time. In this work, we address CLIPP by collecting large-scale, multi-modal datasets to examine the diffusion of online YouTube videos on Reddit. We analyze these datasets to construct community influence graphs (CIGs) and develop a novel dynamic graph framework, INPAC (Information Pathway Across Online Communities), which incorporates CIGs to capture the temporal variability and multi-modal nature of video propagation across communities. Experimental results in both warm-start and cold-start scenarios show that INPAC outperforms seven baselines in CLIPP.

## ðŸ¤— HuggingFace Dataset

We constructed real-world, large-scale datasets covering 60 months of Reddit posts sharing YouTube videos, from January 2018 to December 2022, available on ðŸ¤— HuggingFace (<a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/Ahren09/reddit">Ahren09/reddit</a>)

Install the `datasets` library:

```bash
pip install datasets
```

You can load the dataset using:

```python]
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("Ahren09/reddit", "2018") 
```

where "2018" is the subset name. Replace it with "2019", ..., "2022" to load the other subsets

## Installation


```angular2html
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
conda install pyg -c pyg
conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow
```


## Run the code

NOTE: To avoid any import or path issues, it is recommended to use PyCharm.  

For the large dataset, run

```
python main.py --dataset_name large --do_static_modeling --session_split_method session --delta_t_thres 4.13625 --do_val

```

For the small dataset, run

```
python main.py --dataset_name small --do_static_modeling --session_split_method session --delta_t_thres 4.13625 --do_val

```

- `dataset_name`: `small` for the 3-month Small dataset, `large` for the 54-month Large dataset.
- `delta_t_thres`: The precomputed threshold in Section 3.2. You can also run without specifying `delta_t_thres` and let the code compute it for you.
- `c`, `mu`, `sigma`: Hyperparameters in the equation $\delta t^{thres} = \mu - c \sigma$.
- `resource`: `v` for video. We will include more types of resources in the future, such as `url`
- `eval_neg_sampling_ratio`: the number of negative items to sample for each positive interaction. This is for evaluation.
- `eval_every`: evaluate the model every `eval_every` epochs.

Each row represents a video $v_i$ being shared in a subreddit $s_j$ by some user $u_k$ at some time $t$. We retain videos that have been shared in >=3 online communities (subreddits). The filtered dataset is stored in `reddit_dataset.pkl` along with the mappings.
